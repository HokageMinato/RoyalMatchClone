# RoyalMatchClone
A practice project to replicate match-3 gameplay similar to Royal Match made with unity.
Royal Match gameplay has a very unique mechanic where 
players are allowed to combine multiple swipes **during** an already on-going element fall time of previous swipe and partially locking grid instead of
locking the entire grid.

My code utilises approach of seperating simulation from visualization, similar to networked gameplay, and locking of active grid area to prevent 
desyc between multiple swipe inputs. 

There are few bugs and booster implementation remains pending since I abondoned when I started with my own game.
Core is free to use, modify publish anything and holds MIT License.

Nevertheless do ping me incase of any doubts and would be glad if it helps you!.
